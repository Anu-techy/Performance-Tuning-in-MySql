**Net invoice sales** refers to the total amount of sales revenue that a company recognizes on an invoice after accounting for any deductions, such as discounts, allowances, returns, or any other reductions that might apply.

                                          Net invoice sales = Gross Price - Pre invoice Deductions
                                          
**Post invoice Deductions** are reductions made to the amount due on an invoice after it has been issued. These deductions usually occur after the sale has been completed and the invoice has been sent, and they can be due to various volumne discounts, returns, product defects, shipping delays etc.

**Net sales** refers to the total revenue a company generates from selling goods or services after accounting for all deductions such as discounts, returns, allowances, and any other adjustments.
